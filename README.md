Absolutely — I got you! Based on everything we’ve worked through, here’s a clean, updated `README.md` you can drop into your project. It covers:

- Setup
- Docker
- The SQLite DB handling
- Frontend/backend info
- CORS/setup notes

---

## 🧠 `README.md` — For `spotify_dashboard`

```markdown
# 🎧 Spotify Dashboard

A full-stack data visualization dashboard for exploring Spotify artist data, powered by:

- 🔁 **React + Vite** frontend
- 🐍 **Django + DRF** backend
- 💽 **Precomputed SQLite database** for artist/audio feature similarity
- 🐳 Dockerized for easy setup and deployment

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker)

### ✅ Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Git

---

### 📦 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bmocc/Spotify-Dashboard.git
cd Spotify-Dashboard
```

---

### 📂 Add the Database File

> **Important:** The precomputed SQLite file is **not included** in the repo (too large for GitHub).

You’ll need to:

1. Download `spotify_filtered.sqlite` from the shared link:  
   👉 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-xX6-fOvYAXG7vwF5XIPrmnPjh9_m4rP/view?usp=drive_link

2. Place the file in the **project root**, like this:

```
spotify_dashboard/
├── backend/
├── frontend/
├── docker-compose.yml
└── spotify_filtered.sqlite ✅
```

---

### 🐳 Build and Run with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:

- Start the Django backend at: http://localhost:8000  
- Start the React frontend (Vite) at: http://localhost:3000 (or 8000 if served via Django)

---

## 🧪 Features

- 🔎 Search for artists and retrieve audio-based similarity rankings
- 📈 Visualizations powered by Vite + React
- 📊 Cosine similarity on precomputed feature vectors using scikit-learn
- 🔐 CORS-safe API access for local frontend/backend interaction

---

## ⚙️ Developer Setup (Without Docker)

1. **Backend**

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```

2. **Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_here
DEBUG=True
```

Update `settings.py` to read from `os.environ` or use `python-decouple`.
